<h1>Jason's take on Mr Wolf and Mama Bear</h1>

<p>I think the song is about World War II and it's aftermath.  I'll go through it line by line and explain my reasoning:</p>
 
<p>Mr. Wolf and Mama Bear were banging on the door...
 - Mama Bear is easy, "mother" Russia and the communist bear were common metaphors for the USSR.  So Mama Bear is the USSR.  Mr. Wolf is the USA.  The lone wolf could be symbolic of the US's stance at the time, and wolves are smart andcan be seen as diabolical at times but still noble in a way.  The US and USSR are both banging on the world's door, vying for the title of "Superpower" and now it's right before WWII and both are positioning themselves to become the worlds two superpowers.</p>
 
<p>I told 'em once, I told 'em twice, don't come 'round here no more. 
- The story is told from the point of view of someone who opposes the cold war and the crooked politics that it represented.  You can take it as a pacifist viewpoint, or just as someone who opposes globalization and all that came with the cold war.</p>
 
<p>They've stolen all our chickens, they killed our neighbor's cat...
- Both the US and the USSR have taken over other countries in an attempt to promote either democracy or communism, andboth use such promotion as a way to steal other nations resources under the guise of helping that country.</p>
 
<p>Last night I saw 'em talking to Big Weasel and his Rat...
- Big Weasel is "Big Oil" and his Rat could be anything associated with that or it could be some other industry or resource that would appeal to the US and the USSR.  Both are seen as using the World War as a way of ensuring that they will be the only superpowers, so they put the plan in motion to create a war that will leave only the US and USSR as powerful nations.  They also use the War to claim various regions that can supply oil and other valuables to their respective countries.</p> 
 
<p>It's such a cozy neighborhood, we love our little town...
- America before the War.  We were insulated from the world by two oceans, and we liked it that way. We don't want globalization, we like America like it is, a simple little town.</p> 
 
<p>Lately things ain't been so good, there's something goin' down.
- Europe and Asia in conflict, the first rumblings of a World War.</p> 
 
<p>It happened just a year ago; someone hired a band...
- Hitler was elected in Germany. Germany needed something to cheer them up after WWI, so they "hired a band" to entertain them, i.e. elected Hitler to pump them up and restore their dignity.</p> 
 
<p>They had a dog and pony show that got clean out of hand...
- The dog and pony show is the Nazi party.  At first it seems like a simple group of people who take pride in their Country, but it "got clean out of hand" as the Nazi's take control of Germany and start campaigns of rampant racism, concentration camps, the killing of all jews, and the Aryan brotherhood.</p>
 
<p>There was fur and feathers flyin',
- the proverbial 'fog of war', especially at the beginning, no one really agrees on when it got out of hand, but we all know that it was a mess real quick.</p>
 
<p>The Son of the Old Goat said Coon-boy (Hitler) pulled a shotgun from his worn out overcoat. 
- Germany sneaks in and invades Poland (i.e. pulling a shotgun from your overcoat) and WWII is started.  The son of the Old Goat is Poland. The Old Goat is a reference to WWI, Poland was re-established by WWI and Woodrow Wilson had a major part in that restoration.  My thought is that the "old" goat just refers to the older generation and since Poland was restored by WWI, it becomes the "son" of the old guard.  He turns to his old friends the UK and the US again and says that he never saw it coming because Hitler walked in and all of the sudden pulled a shotgun from his coat.  In a way, Poland is asking for forgiveness for so quickly letting this happen again.</p>   
 
<p>Bobcat killed Miss Peacock...
- The Bobcat is Japan, bobcats are small, much like the Japs, and very agile and sneaky.  Miss Peacock is China, Japan invades China and the World War is now fully underway.</p>   
 
<p>Coon-boy shot the Mare...
- Hitler (coon-boy) takes over France (the mare), French are weak and girlie, and ugly with long faces much like a mare.</p> 
 
<p>While Mr. Wolf smoked opium and grinned at Mama Bear
- USA (Mr. Wolf) pretends to not care, Roosevelt was always known for his cigarette holder, and it looks similar to what you would use to smoke opium with.  So Roosevelt sits back and smokes and says that we are isolationists, and he thereby allows WWII to escalate knowing the whole time that the outcome of this will be USA and USSR are the only superpowers left.  So he grins at Mama Bear (USSR) thereby letting her know that he will be in the fight but he is playing it cool for now.  He wants there to be no opposition to the US's involvement in the War, he must wait until they are attacked.</p>   
 
<p>Two Dead Ducks lay there beside Miss Peacock on the floor
- Remember Miss Peacock was China.  So now we have Japan claiming two more bodies, in this case, two ducks.  The two dead ducks are the British territories of Malaya and Hong Kong, and the American territory of Hawaii.  Japan attacked both simultaneously with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Both are island nations, seemingly sitting on the ocean as a duck sits on the water.  So now you have Japan killing two "ducks" (read islands) and they lay them down beside Miss Peacock (China) as areas that Japan has attacked and killed.</p>   
 
<p>The Fat Goose (Great Britain) grabbed the telephone and called the Dogs of War (Allies) -
- British people, and Churchill especially, are seen as somewhat snobby and elitist, a proud bunch always waddling around with their chest stuck out and their nose high which resembles the mannerisms of a goose.  So the Fat Goose (Churchill) finally calls up the Dogs of War (the Allies) and says lets get it on, and America finally has their reason to join the war because of Pearl Harbor.</p> 
 
<p>The Guineas begged for mercy, The Pigs began to squeal.
- Italians are commonly referred to as guineas.  Italy was defeated first and somewhat easily and so they are begging for mercy, blaming the war on Hitler.  The Pigs are the rest of the minor axis powers, such as Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, andthe Japanese puppet states.  They begin to squeal, i.e. begin whining that they really didn't want war they were just forced in by the stronger Axis powers and therefore aren't really enemies of the Allies.</p>   
 
<p>Coon-boy took the kitty, jumped in his automobile.
- Hitler, realizing he is defeated, takes what valuables he can and retreats back to Germany.</p> 
 
<p>Bobcat and the wheelman, The Famous Wolverine, shot out the light and in the night they faded from the scene.
- The "Famous Wolverine" refers to the Nazi plan at the end of WWII for a clandestine force which would carry out guerrilla attacks against the Allies in the Allied-occupied regions of Germany.  The plan was called Operation Warewolf, or Operation Wolverine, by the Germans.  So Japan (Bobcat) and Germany shoot out the light, i.e. give up, and fade from the scene.</p> 
 
<p>Chief Detective Rambouillet did not work for free
- This is the one player I cannot identify.</p> 
 
<p>And Sheriff Hog was called away unexpectedly
- Roosevelt unexpectedly dies in office.</p> 
 
<p>The sheriff's re-election, the murder of the Mare, might get Hog implicated with the Wolf and Mama Bear.
- Roosevelt was elected three times and was in position to be elected and unprecedented fourth straight term, however some thought that he had too much power, he was almost like a King, which was what we thought we left behind in England.  So the powers-that-be (Mr. Wolf, and Mama Bear) worried that if he got too powerful he might blow it for them and reveal the whole plot of world domination.</p> 
 
<p>So Rambouillet took up the case then shut it down for good, he bought a house in southern France but lives in Hollywood.
- Rambouillet (whoever he refers to) kills Roosevelt, unleashes nukes on Japan, shows the World that the US has won the warand established itself as a superpower, and this unknown person now lives in France but has powerful friends in the US, specifically Hollywood.</p> 
 
<p>The bodies of the bobcat and the famous Wolverine Were found inside a motel room outside of San Joaquin.
- Hitler kills himself in his bunker and the Japs were nuked.</p> 
 
<p>The city council voted the insurance board to pay the victims of that heinous crime upon that dreadful day -
- The Marshall plan takes effect and the US moves in and basically takes over Japan under the guise of helping them out because we were so harsh on them by dropping nukes.</p> 
 
<p>And I watch from the shadows where beneath a frosty moon, Mr. Wolf and Mama Bear feed on a dead raccoon.
- The US (Mr. Wolf) and the USSR (Mama Bear) take over Germany (remember Coon-boy was Hitler).  Germany is split down the middle, you now have East and West Germany and the US gets half and the USSR gets half.  Metaphorically speaking, the plot is finally over and it worked to perfection, the US and USSR are now the only superpowers, and by stopping Hitler early on, they allow him to threaten the world, thereby allowing them to step in, stop him and in the process take over all the world, something they could have never done in an overt fashion without pissing off everyone.  So now they feed off of what Hitler created.</p> 
 
<p>And the author sits back and watches from the shadows and sees the secret plot that the US and USSR devised.   He knows that WWII wasn't all that it was shown to be.  While the masses see it as a great victory and a war that was forced on us andyet we stepped in and kicked butt, he sees it as a clever plot to covertly take over the world.  The US could have stepped in early and squashed Hitler. And many people believe that Roosevelt knew that Japan was planning an attack on Pearl Harbor.  If the US had stepped in early on they could have destroyed Hitler or Japan and prevented the World War,  but instead, they sat back, allowed him to get too powerful, and ensured that it would take an all out World War to destroy them.  This in turn allowed the US to take over half the world and the USSR to take over the rest.  It then set up the Cold War and allowed the two countries to continue their world domination for the next fifty years.</p> 
 
 
<p>Welp, that's my take on it.  It's not perfect, but let me know what you think.</p>
